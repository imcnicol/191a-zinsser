# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Ian McNicol

Sentences should be simple. Keeping sentences simple is the goal of the writer. The reader should not have to decipher what the writer implying. The trick is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. It is not the reader’s fault if they cannot understand the writer.

Sentences should be clutter-free. Clutter is the enemy of the writer. Each word should serve a purpose. If the word does not serve a purpose in the sentence, it should be removed. Sentences should be pruned of any unnecessary words that do not contribute meaning to a sentence.
